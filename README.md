J'M - Game Engine


  I'm trying out creating a simple 2D game engine in Java.
  
  Right now it support: 
  - Sprite display
  - HitBox:
    - Circle
    - Segment
    - Radius extended Segment
  - Hitbox auto detection from sprite
  - An actuator system ( stuff that make your stuff have *behaviour*)
  - Collision detection
  
  There is a simple example if you want to see, no game have been implemented yet:
  Use the DevellopmentMainTest to launch a quick test.
  (ZQSD to move, french keyboard)
