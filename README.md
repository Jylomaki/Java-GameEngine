J'M - Game Engine


  I'm trying out creating a simple 2D game engine in Java.
  
  Right now it support: 
  - Sprite display
  - Round and radius segment hit Box
  - Hitbox auto detection from sprite (you need to choose the type of hitbox)
  - An actuator system ( stuff that make your stuff have movement)
  - Collision detection
  
  There is a simple example if you want to see, no game have been implemented yet.
